# Study-Buddy (Work in progress)

Study-Buddy is a flash-card app for building custom study decks. I built this project to practice my React/Rails skills, and to help me study all the new technology I want to learn.

Built with:
* Rails 5.1.2 - Backend framework
* React 16.0.0 - Frontend
* React-Router 3.0.5 - React rendering
* Quill 1.3.4 - Rich text editor for flashcard content
* Postgresql - SQL Database
* Rspec, Capybara - Backend testing
* Enzyme, Karma, Jasmine - Frontend testing


More coming soon...
